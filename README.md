Various models applied on titanic dataset. Best machine learning model building. Data cleaning, wrangling,EDA and modelling
Titanic dataset is a Kaggle competition which is a starting point of all Machine Learning aspirants. This is very interesting dataset 
with number of features to look into and get insights. It provides opportunity to do extensive data wrangling and get insights through 
visualization.
My project was to analyze multiple machine learning algorithms and I have calculated mean scores of all models and implemented the model
with best score on train dataset on test dataset.
